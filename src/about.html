## About me

My name is Emil Ernerfeldt and I am a programmer working and living in Stockholm, Sweden.

I am the CTO and co-founder of [rerun.io](https://www.rerun.io/) where I create a visualization toolbox for computer vision and robotics.

I tweet [@ernerfeldt](https://twitter.com/ernerfeldt).

I am the author of a few popular C++ libraries hosted on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/emilk/), including
[egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) and [Loguru](https://github.com/emilk/loguru).

### My professional history

## About this blog
This is my personal blog, which I use as a pulpit to spread ideas I deem interesting or important. The ideas expressed are that of me, and not that of any employer past or present.

I have chosen not to have any advertisements, as I want a nice, clean and fast website.

In the summer of 2018 I moved the site to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and rewrote all my existing articles using [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/). In the process I removed all existing comments on the articles, as well as the ability to make new ones. I also made some minor changes to the wording in the existing articles.

If you have any bug reports or comments, file an issue on https://github.com/emilk/blog/issues
