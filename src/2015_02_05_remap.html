# What a difference a function makes
<p id="date">February 5, 2015</p>

When you are writing games, UI:s or graphics there is constantly a need to map one range to another. Let me give you a few examples:

* Fade out something starting at time `T0` and ending at time `T1`.
* Map the distance to a light source to the strength of the light.
* Take a generated noise value in `[-1,+1]` and map it to a small change in height of the water in a lake.
* Encode a normal vector as RGB24 (map the range `[-1,+1]` to `[0, 255]`).

So you constantly find yourself writing code like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C
alpha = 1 - saturate((time - start_time) / (end_time - start_time));
normal_encoded = 255 * (normal + 1) / 2;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is tedious, error prone and makes for code that is difficult to read. Still, I wrote the code. For over a decade I wrote the code, never reflecting on why. Then one day last year I saw an artist at Arrowhead trying to do the above using nodes in a shader-graph (a graph-based visual programming language where every single operation is a big box connected to other boxes). Needless to say, it looked like spaghetti with meatballs.

And I was enlightened. What was needed was a simple linear transform, like this:

![*PROGRAMMER ART TRIGGER WARNING*: A horrible visualization of mapping one number line onto another.](2015_02_05_remap/remap.png)

There should be a function for that, so I wrote one. Actually, I wrote two, and this is what they look like in C:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
inline float remap(float x, float in_min, float in_max,
                   float out_min, float out_max)
{
    float t = (x - in_min) / (in_max - in_min);
    return lerp(out_min, out_max, t);
}

inline float remap_clamp(float x, float in_min, float in_max,
                         float out_min, float out_max)
{
    float t = (x - in_min) / (in_max - in_min);
    t = clamp(t, 0, 1);
    return lerp(out_min, out_max, t);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have these for HLSL, GLSL, Lua, C and as a shader node for artists to use. I also have it overloaded for vectors and colors. Let’s look at a few use cases.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
alpha = remap_clamp(time, fade_start, fade_stop, 1, 0);
normal_encoded = remap(normal, -1, +1, 0, 255);
normal = remap(normal_encoded, 0, 255, -1, +1);
brightness = remap_clamp(distance, inner_radius, outer_radius, 1, 0);
water_height = remap(noise, -1, +1, min_height, max_height);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It makes writing and reading the code an order of magnitude easier. That’s a great return of investment!

What similar aha-moments have you had? Tell me in the comments or on [/r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2v6fa2/what_a_difference_a_function_makes/)!


!!! Note
    To be clear: I do not claim to have invented anything novel here, I'm just trying to convey the joy of having an aha-moment. There are plenty of [implementations at Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Map_range).

## PS
So what if you want a non-linear transform? No problem, I have another overload for that:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
inline float remap_clamp(float x, float in_min, float in_max,
                         float out_min, float out_max, float(*ease)(float))
{
    float t = (x - in_min) / (in_max - in_min);
    t = clamp(t, 0, 1);
    t = ease(t);
    return lerp(out_min, out_max, t);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usage is simple:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
height = remap_clamp(time, time_start, time_stop,
                     max_height, min_height, bounce_ease_out);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
