# Music


## My music
I am a hobby composer, playing guitar and keyboard (neither one particularly well). Here are some of my compositions:


### "Rat" (piano) – 2020
<audio controls src="music/emil_ernerfeldt_rat_2020_04_02.m4a" />

Simple yet lovely, though not quite finished.


### "Jazz" (piano) – 2018
<audio controls src="music/emil_ernerfeldt_jazz_2018_08_10.m4a" />

This was my first composition on the Roland FP-30 electric piano I bought in spring 2018. The title comes from the "jazzy" 7th chords in it (though the result doesn't sound very jazzy at all). I am very happy with the chords progression in this one. It also stretches my playing ability to the limit, and I spent a lot of time just practicing playing it.

This is a live recording using one of the Piano synths in Logic Pro X.


### "Waltzy blues" – 2017
<audio controls src="music/emil_ernerfeldt_waltzy_blues_2017_06_11.m4a" />

A short and simple composition which I'm very happy about. Using just two instruments, composed in Logic Pro X.


### "Burden of Heart" – 2016
<audio controls src="music/emil_ernerfeldt_burden_of_heart_2018_08_13.m4a" />

A composition I made for an uncompleted game. The mood I aimed for was "a fun but scary mystery". You'll be the judge of whether or not I succeeded. Made in Logic Pro X.


### "Phun Theme" – 2005-2007
<audio controls src="music/emil_ernerfeldt_phun_theme_2007.mp3" />

Originally composed late 2005 it slowly evolved until I recorded it in FL Studio in 2007. This was the first composition I spend a lot of time producing and polishing. When in 2008 it was time to publish a video of my master thesis Phun, I picked this composition as the accompanying music, and the music was given its current title. [The video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H5g9VS0ENM) went viral, and I have gotten some very nice feedback for the music, including a [a dance remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq1haqyoRYw) and [a cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWwA4MJccoE)!
