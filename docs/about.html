# About

## About me

My name is Emil Ernerfeldt and I am a programmer working and living in Stockholm, Sweden.

I studied computing science at [Umeå University](http://www.umu.se/english/), where my master thesis was the popular 2D physics sandbox [Phun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H5g9VS0ENM). At [Algoryx Simulation](http://www.algoryx.se/) I was the lead programmer for the physics education app [Algodoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvAVQ6GEv-E). At [Arrowhead Game Studios](http://arrowheadgamestudios.com/) I did graphics, engine and game programming for [Gauntlet]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauntlet_(2014_video_game)"). I did computer vision and accurate, fast 3D mesh reconstruction at [Volumental](https://www.volumental.com/). I currently work with bot defense at [Distil Networks](https://www.distilnetworks.com/).

I am most happy in writing Rust or C++ in Sublime on a Macbook.

I am the author of a few popular C++ libraries hosted on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/emilk/), including [Loguru](https://github.com/emilk/loguru), [Configuru](https://github.com/emilk/Configuru) and [emilib](https://github.com/emilk/emilib).

I tweet [@ernerfeldt](https://twitter.com/ernerfeldt).

## About this blog
This is my personal blog, which I use as a pulpit to spread ideas I deem interesting or important. The ideas expressed are that of me, and not that of any employer past or present.

I have chosen not to have any advertisements, as I want a nice, clean and fast website.

 In the summer of 2018 I moved the site to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and rewrote all my existing articles using [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/). In the process I removed all existing comments on the articles, as well as the ability to make new ones. I also made some minor changes to the wording in the existing articles.

 If you have any bug reports or comments, file an issue on https://github.com/emilk/blog/issues
