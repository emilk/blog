# Responsiveness
<p id="date">May 13, 2014</p>

Click this button. Go ahead!

<center>
  <img src="2014_05_13_responsiveness/click_me.png" width="96" height="32" onclick="this.src='2014_05_13_responsiveness/good_job.png'" />
</center>

Well, that was dull! Like any sensible button, when you clicked it, something happened. That's what buttons are designed to do. Then there is this kind of button:

<center>
  <img src="2014_05_13_responsiveness/click_me.png" width="96" height="32" onclick="var self = this; setTimeout(function(){
          self.src='2014_05_13_responsiveness/good_job.png';
      }, 4000);" />
</center>

How did that feel? Did you wonder if something was wrong? Did you perhaps click it several times? Did you suspect at some point that it wasn't a button at all? Of course you did. Sadly, these types of buttons can be found in bad user interfaces everywhere – from ticket machines to ATM:s, from web sites to coffee machines.

The difference between a good button and a bad button is called *responsiveness*. Whenever you interact with something that something should respond right away to tell you that you action was recognized. If it fails to respond it feels inert, like a rock. A button should not a be a rock. It should yield and tell you that you managed to hit it and that the computer is now doing your bidding.

Of course it's now always possible to deliver a result right away. Sometimes you have to wait for a slow process to complete – tickets needs to be printed, money counted, web sites rendered and coffee grounded. *But that's no excuse to fail to give feedback!* Here, try this:

<center>
    <img src="2014_05_13_responsiveness/click_me.png" width="96" height="32" onclick="var self = this; self.src='2014_05_13_responsiveness/wait.png';
    setTimeout(function(){
        self.src='2014_05_13_responsiveness/good_job.png';
    }, 4000);" />
</center>

Like in the previous example the result ("Good job!") was delivered in four seconds, but this time you *knew* that you had managed to click a working button and that the machine was now busy doing something. That makes all the difference!
