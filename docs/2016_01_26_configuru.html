# Introducing Configuru – the user friendly config library for C++
<p id="date">January 25, 2016</p>


## Background
In my previous blog post, entitled [*You deserve great error messages*](2016_01_25_error_messages.html) I wrote about how all API:s should provide great error messages, and that config libraries (JSON parsers etc) have been in particular lacking in this area. I also introduced the idea of warning about keys that are never read in code, as that is most likely a bug.

In this blog post I introduce a C++ library for parsing, editing and writing config files which follow the ideas set out in [the previous blog post](2016_01_25_error_messages.html). I strongly recommend you read through that article before reading on.

## Configuru
For a home game project I started on last year I developed [*Configuru*](https://github.com/emilk/configuru), a C++ Config library which handles JSON as well as a simplified/extended dialect of JSON that I simply call *CFG*. The library has great JSON compliance and although it does not compete with other libraries in speed, it does, I believe, have the best error messages of any library out there. Here are just a few examples ([more on GitHub](https://github.com/emilk/configuru#error-messages)):

~~~ C
config.json:1:16: Expected : after object key
{ "is_this_ok" = false }
               ^

`config.json:4: Failed to find key 'keyname'`
(The line number is that of the object missing they key.)


`config.json:2: Key 'colour' never accessed`
~~~

This last one is particular interesting because it is an example of something you are used to seeing from compilers (warning about unused variables), but I doubt you have ever seen from a JSON parser before. The motivation for this particular warning is described in detail in [the previous blog post](2016_01_25_error_messages.html).

Configuru also has some other very nice (and optional) features:

### Enforces indentation
A lot of non-programmers struggles with keeping their `[]` and `{}` matched because they do not have the habit of indenting. This leads to messy looking config files and when a brace is forgotten it can be hell to figure out where they should go. Configuru enforces indentation which means that if you forget a bracket or brace, Configuru will name the exact line where it should have appeared (or the exact line where you used the wrong indentation). The error messages are also helpful (`config.json:42: Bad indentation: expected 3 tabs, got 2`).

Enforcing indentation may make you think of Python, but interestingly this has also [been added to GCC6](https://gnu.wildebeest.org/blog/mjw/2016/01/09/looking-forward-to-gcc6-nice-new-warnings/) as an optional warning (a warning which would have caught [one of the worst OSX security vulnerabilities](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/02/22/applebug.html)).

### Preserves comments
When you load a config file and edit it (in C++) and save it again, all comments will still be there in the written file attached to the right key/value. This is great for when you have a hand-written config-file (with helpful comments) and have an in-game editor (slider etc) for adjusting values in the config file.

### Much much more
If you use the CFG format you get:

* Python-style multi-line strings.
* C#-style verbatim strings.
* Binary and hexadecimal numbers.
* +inf, -inf, +NaN are valid numbers.
* Optional trailing commas in lists and objects.
* All commas optional.
* Extremely pretty printing.

Configuru is a single header and in public domain.
